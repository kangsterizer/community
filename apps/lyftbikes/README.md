# Lyft bikes


This app supports multiple docking stations one a single display. For a simple, single docking station display only, look for the BayWheels app instead. This allows you to customize the name of the station and to understand at a glance which of your nearby stations have available bikes.

## Limitations
- Supports up to 3 or 4 stations max before reaching display limits.

## Todo
- Refactor a bit
- Make the URL customizable for non-Lyft GBFS support (perhaps just rename the app too then)
- Allow user to customize refresh rate since it matters quite a bit here (default = 240s)
- Change configuration to auto detect nearby docking stations based on geolocation
- Add current "most range" available for the ebikes (eg if ebike with most range is 17mi, display that)
